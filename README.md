SWE-6813, Winter 2022 Development Project: GamersMeet Team Members: Frank Wear, Jerry Cowell Jr, Steven Carter, Takyi Obeng , Kyla Okobah
Scrum Roles:

Product Owner - Takyi Obeng
Scrum Master – Frank Wear
Technical Lead for Operations and Development - Kyla Okobah
Lead for Front-End Development - Jerry Cowell Jr.
Lead for Back-end Development - Steven Carver


Project Metrics:
Ultimately, if prioritization becomes uncertain, WSJF analysis can be done to prioritize selection and implementation order during sprint planning.
https://www.scaledagileframework.com/wsjf/.  However, for the most part prioritization and work item implementation order will be based on metrics included
by default in the DevOps templates rather than by using this evaluation technique.  All metrics, dependancies and Product Owner direction will impact the implementation order.

Priorities:
Priority is the estimation of criticality of the work item to the function of the application.  It is only one factor in evaluating implementation order.

Priority 1 - Critical - Items Marked Critical must be done for the system to function at all or which present a significant security risk (e.g. allowing a user to select contacts)
Priority 2 - High - Items marked Critical are components that significantly impact the usability or business value of the application (e.g. allowing a user to specify his enterests)
Priority 3 - Medium - Items marked Medium are significant extensions to the service or services already offered, encouraging higher engagement of users (e.g. strategically adding
  another game API)
Priority 4 - Low - Items marked Low are improvements that will make use of the system easier or more intuitive (e.g. match stack display allowing user to flip through the stack)

Story Points:
The Story Points will utilize the Fibonacci series to estimate the developer effort necessary to complete a task or user story. (1,2,3,5,8,13,21) Story points and hours are not
necessarily related, but can be used to estimate the work items that can be completed in a sprint.  Story points take into account grooming time, any knowledge gaps of the participants,
implementation time, acceptance criteria and verification of success.

Labor Estimates:
This is where we estimate the number of hours necessary to complete a task.  Labor estimates are at the task level and include the research or investigation time necessary to 
investigate API interfaces, grooming to prevent impact elsewhere in the program and implemention of the solution.

Risks:
This is an an assessment of any identified risks.  These may include disruption of service, failure to complete the work, or the cost of failed security.  The risks and explanation
of the assessment are noted in User Story discussion.  Risks are low-medium-high.


Procedures:

Scrum:
This team will operate within the Scrum framework.  As such, work will be scheduled in sprints and planned in sprint planning meetings.  Each sprint will be followed by a sprint review
to celebrate our successes and a sprint retrospective to solidify and implement process changes that help the team function more effectively.  The team will also hold standup
meetings 3 times a week, which is comparable to a working environment where standup meetings are heald every day for full-time employees.

Sprint Planning:
At the sprint planning meeting planners will make a commitment to achieve selected User Stories at the User Story level.  The review will include assessment, grooming and full
definition of all user stories implemented that sprint.  This will include a full definition of the acceptance criteria and any tasks that appropriately decompose that stories.  If
a User Story will only be partially completed during a sprint, it will be split into two user stories, preferably resulting in a functional improvement implemented at the end of the
sprint under consideration.

Combing Item Listing Order:
Items in the backlog will be ranked manually by the Product Owner in coordination with the Scrum Master and development team.  The order will take into account any approriate metrics, 
dependancies and Product Owner preferences.

Assignment:
Work Items, whether User Story or Task are self-assigned per the Scrum Framework.  Each team member is expected to select a set up up to 5 User Stories that he will actively implement.
Before accepting more assignments, the team member must de-assign or complete one of his user stories.  A review of assignements, accomplishment toward them, plans and impediments
are the agenda of every standup meeting.  Each team member is expected to be able to hold his own in that meeting, which he does by self-assigning User Stories that he wants to
implement.

Story splitting:
In the event that a user story has not been successfully completed, or is initially not expected to be completed within one sprint, the team will implement this procedure to split
the User Story into two stories, thus maintaining sprint integrity, contribution tracking and task assignment.

Resources:

MS Teams for chat, video, file, and link sharing.  We have 4 channels whose names are self-explanatory.:

Azure Devops for Project and Sprint Management.  Team 2 stores its Kanban (US level) and Sprint (Task level) boards as well as the project backlog in DevOps Boards.  It is configured
as an “Agile” project which allows elements from both Scrum and Kanban frameworks.  The project also includes a dashboard and repository, which will be included below as separate

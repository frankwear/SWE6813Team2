In Sprint 2, I believe we will be able to complete about 15 story points.  My reasoning is that on this sprint we completed 11 story points plus we will split 1 user story
that had 2 storypoints, so we can estimate 12 complete this sprint.

In Sprint 1, we spent a lot of time setting up our individual development environments, learning to start the server and displaying out application before we even began development.
We had a significant learning curve.  However, many of the story points were precisely to do those things.  The next sprint, I believe we will be able to concentrate more on
development and less time troubleshooting issues.  For this reason, I believ we will be able to be more productive in the application itself, and some of the work will be closer
to routine.  For this reason, I believe we will be more productive this sprint.

So, Team 2 is estimating 15 story points in Sprint 2.
